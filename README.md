# R6GameServicePatcher
Patches offsets to permanently bypass the master server "phone-home" function in R6GameService.DLL

Pre-compiled if you just want to run latest v1.1 (Located in folder: ../Release/R6GameService_Patcher.exe)

NOTE: This was whipped up quickly in order to give server admins/players who were unfamiliar with hex editing an easy way to patch their local DLLs
